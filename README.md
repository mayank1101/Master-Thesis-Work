# Master-Thesis

## Medical Image Super-Resolution
* My master’s thesis, titled **Quantitative Analysis of Super-Resolution on Medical Image Pathology** was
conducted during my master's at IIT Jammu, under the supervision of Prof. Harkeerat Kaur and Prof. Bakul Goel.
* In this research, I implemented and evaluated multiple state-of-the-art super-resolution models—including SRCNN, ESPCN, SRGAN, WDSR, and EDSR—across medical imaging datasets spanning various modalities. The study involved comprehensive quantitative analysis using metrics such as RMSE, PSNR, SSIM, MS-SSIM, SCC, and VIFP, with a dedicated focus on both normal and pathological images. I separately assessed quality degradation within disease-specific regions to understand the clinical implications of super-resolution techniques. The research hypothesis was statistically validated using the Mann-Whitney U Test.
